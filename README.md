# Cipher
## Description
caesarCipher takes a key (an positive integer) and encodes the program's string "This is a test!" using the key in a Caesar Cipher.

vigenereCipher takes a keyword (a string) and does the same as a Caesar Cipher but using the values of each letter in the keyword lined up with the letters in the string to be encoded. This one encodes the string "This is a test sentence. It works!"
